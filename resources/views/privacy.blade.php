                <br>
                <p>This privacy statement (&ldquo;Privacy Statement&rdquo;)
                    applies to
                    the treatment of personally identifiable information submitted by, or otherwise obtained from, you in
                    connection
                    with the associated application (&ldquo;Application&rdquo;). The Application is provided by PartGov (and
                    may be
                    provided by PartGov on behalf of a PartGov licensor or partner (&ldquo;Application Partner&rdquo;). By
                    using or
                    otherwise accessing the Application, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined
                    in this
                    Privacy Statement.&nbsp;<br/><br/>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES PartGov COLLECT?&nbsp;<br/><br/>We
                    collect the
                    following types of information from our users:&nbsp;<br/><br/>Personal Information You Provide to
                    Us:<br/>We may
                    receive and store any information you submit to the Application (or otherwise authorize us to obtain
                    &ndash;
                    such as, from (for example) your Facebook account). The types of personal information collected may
                    include your
                    full name, email address, gender, IP address, browser information, username, demographic information,
                    and any
                    other information necessary for us to provide the Application services.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Personal
                    Information
                    Collected Automatically:<br/>We receive and store certain types of usage related information whenever
                    you
                    interact with Application. For example, PartGov may automatically receive and record information
                    regarding your
                    computer&rsquo;s IP address, browser information, Facebook user ID, Facebook Page fan status, and URLs
                    accessed.
                    Such information may be shared in aggregate (non-personally identifiable) form with our
                    partners.&nbsp;<br/><br/>HOW DOES PARTGOV USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?&nbsp;<br/><br/>PartGov uses
                    the
                    information described in this Privacy Statement (i) internally, to analyze, develop and improve its
                    products and
                    services, and (ii) as set forth below in the &ldquo;Will PartGov Share any of the personal information
                    it
                    Collects&rdquo; section below.&nbsp;<br/><br/>APPLICATION PARTNER TREATMENT OF PERSONAL
                    INFORMATION.&nbsp;<br/><br/>PartGov may provide personal information to the applicable Application
                    Partner. The
                    Application Partner&rsquo;s use of your personal information is subject to the Application Partner&rsquo;s
                    separate privacy policy &ndash; and not this Privacy Statement. The Application Partner&rsquo;s privacy
                    policy
                    is linked to from within the Partner&rsquo;s Facebook application.&nbsp;<br/><br/>WILL PartGov SHARE ANY
                    OF THE
                    PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?&nbsp;<br/><br/>Personal information about our users is an integral
                    part of our
                    business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone (with the exception of sharing
                    your
                    information with an applicable Application Partner &ndash; see the &ldquo;Application Partner Treatment&rdquo;
                    section above). We share your personal information only as described below.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Application
                    Partners:
                    We will share your personal information with an applicable Application Partner (see the &ldquo;Application
                    Partner Treatment&rdquo; section above).&nbsp;<br/><br/>Agents: We employ other companies and people to
                    perform
                    tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.
                    Unless
                    we tell you differently, PartGov&rsquo;s agents do not have any right to use personal information we
                    share with
                    them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of personal information
                    for the
                    above purposes. Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types
                    of
                    transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred.
                    Moreover, if
                    PartGov, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that PartGov goes
                    out of
                    business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or
                    acquired by a
                    third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of PartGov may
                    continue to use
                    your personal information as set forth in this policy.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Protection of PartGov and Others:
                    We may
                    release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the
                    law;
                    enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety
                    of
                    PartGov, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies
                    and
                    organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.&nbsp;<br/><br/>With Your Consent: Except
                    as set
                    forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and
                    will be
                    able to prevent the sharing of this information.&nbsp;<br/><br/>CONDITIONS OF USE.&nbsp;<br/><br/>If you
                    decide
                    to use or otherwise access the Application, your use/access and any possible dispute over privacy is
                    subject to
                    this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes,
                    and
                    application of California state law.&nbsp;<br/><br/>THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS/WEBSITES.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The
                    Application may permit you to link to other applications or websites. Such third party
                    applications/websites are
                    not under PartGov&rsquo;s control, and such links do not constitute an endorsement by PartGov of those
